# Bachelor Project - Generalized Brocard-Ramanujan Problem: A Lean Formalization via the abc-conjecture 
## Stefan Lica -- VU Amsterdam

This is the Lean code for my Bachelor Thesis. The main result is that for any polynomial with integer coefficients and of degree at least 2, the abc-conjecture implies that the equation P(x) = n! has finitely many integer solutions (x, n)
